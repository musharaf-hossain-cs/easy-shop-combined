# Easy Shop Combined

## Introduction

The **Easy Shop Combined** repository serves as a parent repository containing two submodules:

- [Easy Shop Frontend](https://github.com/musharaf-hossain-cs/easy-shop-frontend.git): The frontend part of the Easy Shop application.
- [Easy Shop Backend](https://github.com/musharaf-hossain-cs/easy-shop-backend.git): The backend part of the Easy Shop application.

This combined repository is designed to help you manage both frontend and backend codebases conveniently. It allows you to work on both parts of your project separately while keeping them organized within a single parent repository.

## Getting Started

To start working with this project, you need to initialize and update the submodules.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/musharaf-hossain-cs/easy-shop-combined.git
cd easy-shop-combined
```

### Initialize Submodules

```bash
git submodule init
```

### Update Submodules

```bash
git submodule update
```

This will fetch the latest code for both the frontend and backend submodules.

## Working with Submodules
